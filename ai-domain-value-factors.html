        <h1>AI Domain Value Factors</h1>
        <p class="article-intro">Not all AI domains are created equal. Length, extension, pronunciation, trademark risk and brand potential all influence value. Here’s how to think about what a domain like Aiexor.com is worth.</p>
      </header>
      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Core Structural Factors</h2>
        <p>Buyers and investors look first at basic structure: TLD, length and clarity. .com remains the most valuable extension; six‑letter, one‑word names are rare; and domains without hyphens or numbers are far more desirable. Aiexor.com sits in a strong position on all three counts.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Brand and Visual Potential</h2>
        <p>An AI domain with good visual potential can be turned into a logo, icon and full design system without fighting the letterforms. Aiexor has a balanced mix of angles and curves, making it a great base for a premium identity across web, mobile and print.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Strategic Fit and Timing</h2>
        <p>Value also depends on who is buying, what they&apos;re building and how soon they need to launch. For a founder racing to own a unique, ownable AI brand before a major release, the right domain is often worth far more than the raw market estimate.</p>
