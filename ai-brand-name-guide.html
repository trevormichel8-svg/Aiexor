        <h2>Start With the Feeling, Not the Feature</h2>
        <p>Most AI founders start by trying to describe what the product does. Strong brands start with how they want customers to feel — confident, empowered, safer, faster. From there, they choose a name that can stretch as the product evolves, instead of locking into one feature that may be obsolete in a year.</p>

        <h2>Check for Friction in Everyday Use</h2>
        <p>A useful test: imagine the name on Zoom intros, calendar invites, invoices and Slack channels. If you have to spell it three times, or people regularly typo it, the name is adding friction. Aiexor is simple enough to live comfortably across all of these touchpoints while still feeling unique.</p>

        <h2>Pair the Name With a Story</h2>
        <p>The name alone is only half the equation. The narrative you build around it matters just as much. Aiexor can easily be framed as a next‑generation AI engine, a core intelligence layer or a family of agents — giving you room to tie the story to whatever you ship next.</p>
