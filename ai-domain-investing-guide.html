        <h2>Buy for Brand, Not Just Search</h2>
        <p>Search can change. Algorithms evolve. But a strong brand tends to hold or grow in value over time. When you acquire an AI domain, prioritize how it performs as a brand: memorability, trust, story potential and cross‑channel consistency.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Aim for Versatile Themes</h2>
        <p>Because AI is moving fast, single‑feature names are risky. Versatile domains let you pivot from one feature or vertical to another without needing to rebrand. Aiexor.com can stretch from infrastructure to end‑user products to consulting without breaking.</p>

        <h2>Document Your Ownership</h2>
        <p>If you&apos;re investing in premium AI domains, keep clean records of purchase dates, registrar accounts and transfer history. This makes future sales smoother and reassures serious buyers who want clear proof of ownership before wiring funds.</p>
